# DDD Greenfield ViSX

Idea: I want to improve the speed for setting up a domain driven design oriented project. 

How: This extension should provide project templates to add in a bundle. As a developer, I want to add a new "Feature"
to my existing solution, without adding each project by my self.

To define the idea. This extension should provide templates for features. This adds automaticly a defined basearchitectur for 
CLEAN CODE with DDD. These projects provide baseclasses and boilerplate code. The code will be commented in a teaching style,
explaining the core concepts and design desicions behind the architecture and to explain the use of it.
